/*

	This is the alarm 0 that plays when the player hits a rock. Fittingly, it is in the obj_game
	events, as obj_game is running. 
	
	What we want to do is to re-start the game when the player dies. So, we write room_restart();
	
	Remember to place obj_game in room1 so it can do this! Do it on the instances layer.

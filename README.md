# repo-trial

This is a GitHub familiarization test. The goal was to essentially create a repo, commit, push, create files, etc. Decided to 
introduce myself to GameMaker and use that project as the test repo.

The GameMaker tutorial game was made with the SpaceRocks template (which gave the sprites) and the video follow-along. There are
A couple of personal edits to the game (Like the ability to go backwards, using the Z key to shoot instead of a mouse click) and 
a bunch of comments to help with the familiarization process.

This README is a part of the overall Github familiarization process, along with a couple of commits and properly transferring the files over.
